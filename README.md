# Indian-Names-Generator-Using-Deep-Learning

LSTM architecture is used for the model. The model is trained on 72,000 Indian Names and the model generates new names based on the trained datasets. This model can be used to generate other similar names by training the model on different data set. 

# Instructions on executing the program:
